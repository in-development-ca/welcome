<!-- So! You have a cool open source project that you think would be a good fit for a few months of intensive work in Toronto with our mentors. We think that's awesome. We'll make this simple: Drop a link to the project here, or describe what you would like to do. Then, add a short statement about who you are and what you would like help with from our mentors. Feel free to ask questions here, too. Welcome! -->
