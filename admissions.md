# InDevelopment admissions
This document is meant to be the start of a conversation. Before we determine specific admissions criteria and how we can measure against them, we should work together to define what kind of environment/group dynamics we’re looking for.

## Who we’re looking for

### Self-starters
Working on long-term projects without much direction can be a challenging feat. We should look for demonstrations of this in our candidates or at least strong potential for it. Should be part of the interview process.

### Has a specific plan in mind
While things don’t always work out the way we aim for, candidates should have specific goal posts / milestones / project roadmap when submitting. 

### Works well with others
We want an environment that lends well to collaboration and mutual support. 

### Values inline with our community guidelines

### Previous experience working on an open source project is a plus?
This should be perceived as an asset but nowhere near a deal breaker.
