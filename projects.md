# projects

This repository contains a list of projects that may be in need of a maintainer groupd by language.
Projects descriptions should give a brief overview of the project, and reasons for why it may be of interest.

## Clojure

* [Incanter](http://incanter.org/) is a statistical analysis platform. Clojure is a data oriented language that's a good fit for data analytics. Incanter leverages REPL driven workflow to provide an interactive environment for epxploring data sets. The project is fairly mature, but hasn't seen much maintenance in the past year. Some of the tasks could involve updating Incanter to use the latest libraries, improving performance, and UI experience. One interesting option would be to create an Atom plugin/IDE based on Incanter that would leverage Atom's editing and drawing capabilities.

* [phzr](https://github.com/dparis/phzr/tree/master/src/phzr) is a ClojureScript wrapper for [Phaser.io](http://phaser.io/) Js game engie. Phaser is one of the more accessible 2D game engines with lots of examples and tutorials. Phzr has potential to provide a great interactive environment that could be used for educatin as well as other areas.

* [proto-repl](https://github.com/jasongilman/proto-repl) is a Clojure REPL plugin for Atom. Currently, Atom is one of the most accessible Clojure editors, but the plugin hasn't been maintained and has over 90 issues reported. A lot of issues look like fairly low hanging fruits potentially making it a good project for beginners.

* [Counterclockwise](https://github.com/ccw-ide/ccw) is a Clojure plugin for Eclipse. It's mature and open source, but hasn't seen a lot of attention since Cursive came out. I think there's value in having an open source plugin for a popular Java IDE like Eclipse. It might also be an interesting project to see if CCW can be ported to IntelliJ as well. 

* [sweet-liberty](https://github.com/RJMetrics/sweet-liberty) is a library for automatically generating RESTful API on top of Postgres. The project is functional, but hasn't been updated in about a year with a few outstanding issues.

* [gamma](https://github.com/kovasb/gamma) is a glsl shader generator for ClojureScript. Typically shaders are written as strings, and they can't be composed easily. Gamma represents GLSL shader programs as composable Clojurescript data that can be easily manipulated at runtime.
