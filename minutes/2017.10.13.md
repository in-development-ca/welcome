## In Attendance

- KV
- Dann
- Andrew Tsang (for quick chat about logo)

## Agenda

- Quick Banking update from KV
- Logo design update (Discuss T-sang's logo concepts)
- Website design - revisit next steps and scope

## Updates

Website:

- Dann proposed splitting up wireframe and design, and doing content+wireframe first. KV likes
- Dann to spend 15 - 30 mins for the rest of this meeting (today) to create the sitemap with the high level content that would go into each page/section. Will present in Slack channel. People to comment by Monday.

Logo:

- Dann and KV both liked it, especiall the bottom left ID but the right column where "indevelopment is one word"
- Dann made a good point about indevelopment reading as InDevelopment which is how we ought to write it
- Here's what we asked for from Tsang for v2
  - More like bottom left or bottom right for the ID logo
  - Make I and D capitalized in text and in the logo (more room to change it up in the logo if you want)
  - Since I will be capitalized, try to use a font where the l does not look identical in the text.
  - More colour options other than green, though we like the green


Banking:

- Got the number from CRA. KV to send to TD so account is no longer frozen and can receive some funds (it's currently at -$3.00 due to banking fees)
